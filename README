Welcome to the A5 tinkering folder.

Code placed in this folder is not part A5 rainbow table generator, but
rather bits an pieces of code used for experimenting with table parameters
etc. 

Programs found in here are very much work in progress, and will be in a state
of flux. As such they may suddenly be changed to have different functionality.

Enter at own risk.
